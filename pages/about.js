        Wassim Serhan is a photographer who lives and works
        in New York City. From a young age, Wassim has always had an interest in
        people, a curiosity that inspired him to create photographs, turning the
        mundane into a spectacle illusion. Wassim’s passion for candid street
        style photography started in 2003 where he was part of the team filming
        a documentary about Haiti. Intuition is a key factor in Wassim’s street
        photography work; using the streets as scenes to communicate and
        story-tell. Travel is important for Wassim, learning about new cultures,
        and using the streets as visual playground for inspiration for new
        bodies of work.
